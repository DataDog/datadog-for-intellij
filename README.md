# Datadog for JetBrains IDEs

The [Datadog](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19495-datadog) plugin helps improve software performance by providing
meaningful code-level insights in the IDE
based on real-time observability data. It helps reduce application latency and lower cloud costs by highlighting
specific code lines that consume the most CPU, allocate the most memory and spend the most time on locks, disk I/O,
socket I/O, and more.

The plugin is for developers that use Datadog products including [Error Tracking](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/error_tracking/),
[Log Explorer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/), and the [Continuous Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/profiler/#pagetitle) for their Java, Go, Python and PHP services.

### Plugin Features

The **Code Insights** view keeps you informed about:

- Issues from [Error Tracking](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/error_tracking/)
- [Vulnerability](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/vulnerability_management/) reports by Application Security Management
- [Flaky tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/guides/flaky_test_management/) detected by CI Visibility
- Profiling insights from [Watchdog Insights](https://docs.datadoghq.com/watchdog/insights/)

The **Continuous Profiler** helps you to reduce latency and lower cloud costs by highlighting code lines that:

- Consume the most CPU
- Allocate the most memory
- Spend the most time on locks, disk I/O, and socket I/O

The **Logs support** shows observed logs in source code, as detected from [Log patterns](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/analytics/patterns/),
and provides links to the Datadog Log Explorer to view logs generated by a specific line of code. 

The **CI Test Runs** feature opens the Continuous Integration Visibility Explorer to show recent runs for a selected test.

The **[Static Analysis](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/static_analysis/?tab=githubactions)** integration, in beta, analyzes your code (locally) against predefined rules to detect and
fix problems before you commit changes.
